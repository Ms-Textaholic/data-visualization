        <p>This chart shows annual mean land-ocean temperatures from 1880 to 2014, for global and hemispheres. The
            Y-axis shows the temperature in degrees celsius while the X-axis shows the year.</p>
        <p>The global trend seems to be only slightly increasing from 1880-1940, followed by a peak during 1944 and then
            a more rapid increase from 1965.</p>
        <p>When it gets into the 21st Century, the temperature in Northern Hemisphere is always higher than that in
            Southern Hemisphere, which is also growing faster.</p>
